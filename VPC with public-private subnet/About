This project tells how to create a VPC and how to secure a VPC during production.

To improve resiliency, you deploy the servers in two Availability Zones, by using an autoscaling group and an Application Load Balancer.
For additional security, you deploy the servers in private subnets. The server receives requests through the load balancer. 
The servers can connect to internet ny using a NAT gateway. To improve resilienc, you deploy the NAT gateway in both Availability zones.
